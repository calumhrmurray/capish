    "# The validity of power-laws\n",
    "\n",
    "Unknown. A good old reference is from Kaiser 1980 something. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Can we reproduce the results of Salcedo 2023 in an analytical manner? Maybe, if we assume the only effect is the varying background. This seems to be pretty much the case for them given how they generate their halos. Let’s try.\n",

    "The galaxy field,\n",
    "\n",
    "delta_g = delta_1h + delta_2h + delta_field\n",

    "The weak lensing field,\n",
    "\n",
    "kappa = kappa_1h + kappa_2h + kappa_field\n",
    "\n",
    "For massive halos, delta_1h >> delta_field and kappa_1h >> kappa_field. \n",
    "\n",
    "For less massive halos this is no longer true. Therefore at fixed mass for none massive halos it is fairly natural that the correlation should be higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this starting point we can probably get something reasonable, or at least a reasonable form with the scatter. Lets try. Both of these fields can be related through the underlying matter density field. In the end what we need is not exactly what I have written but instead some kind of cylindrical average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have instead,\n",
    "\n",
    "delta_m = delta_1h + delta_2h + delta_field\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that here delta_field is just completely a random variable. From some maths ideally we would end up with a lambda_obs and m_wl_obs. In practice this seems unachievable. Instead we should be able to get something close to lambda_obs (maybe it could be related to lambda_obs with a power-law, in this case we should have the noise or a form for the noise, which is what is important) and a ESD profile. From the ESD profile we can easily estimate the mass that this represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOOh, of course the mean delta_g and kappa fields will just be correct, but what we care about is the scatter…. which will have a long tail. This is okay, we can try and calculate the variance. The variance in a cylinder so,\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a field,\n",
    "\n",
    "s = d + n\n",
    "\n",
    "we are considered with the average in a cylinder,\n",

    "<s> = \\int d2 theta A(theta) s(theta) = s, over many realisations\n",
    "\n",
    "The noise on this will be,\n",
    "\n",
    "Var(<s>) = \\int dl/{2pi} C^{nn}(l) J^{\\hat}_0( l theta )^2\n",
    "\n",
    "where J^{\\{hat}}_0 is the bessel function of the zeroth kind averaged over the annulus. That’s nice. Now we just need to think about what this noise field is. For the galaxy field it should just be the field with a little bit of width. For the lensing field it is even simpler since it is just the ulss term which we know anyway. Okay we know the ulss term for the lensing. I do not see why the 2h is not directly noisy? It should be. Its a bit random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay lensing,\n",
    "\n",
    "kappa = int ..\n",
    "\n",
    "but actually we need the correlated noise between the two fields… in the end\n",

    "Lets try the ulss term for the galaxy field.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually in order to get the correlation between the richness and lensing is a bit of a harder task, getting the variance would not be too bad perhaps. Getting the variance is still interesting since we would see it be a large function of the halo mass.\n",
