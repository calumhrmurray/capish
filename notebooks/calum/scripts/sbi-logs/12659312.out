Running SBI with 100 simulations...
Generating simulation samples from prior...
Running simulations (this may take a while)...
  Progress: 50/100 (50.0%) - Elapsed: 2.2m - ETA: 2.2m - NaNs: 40
  Progress: 100/100 (100.0%) - Elapsed: 4.1m - ETA: 0.0m - NaNs: 80

Simulations completed in 4.1 minutes
Average time per simulation: 2.48 seconds
Total NaN/Inf simulations: 81/100 (81.0%)

WARNING: Only 19 valid simulations!
Consider:
  1. Narrowing prior ranges further
  2. Increasing total number of simulations
  3. Checking for issues in the simulator

Training neural density estimator...
SBI will automatically exclude NaN/Inf simulations...
